Here are a few things I'd like to see done in Flash!

* FreeBSD support fixed.
* configure should be able to work out the programs you have
  and make the sample config from that.
* Some things in the makefile, like LIBDIR, cannot be changed
  without breaking the compile.
* Some compilers really dont like parsing nc_about.c
* rpms and debs produced.
* configure to produce a makefile that works across all OS's!
  currently for example you must make manual changes for Solaris
* release patches for common programs and/or give guidelines
  on how to make the programs within flash secure (mutt/vi etc)
* fix `flash -v` - segfaults
