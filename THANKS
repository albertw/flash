Flash was originally written (see README) by Steve Fegan, but there are 
several others who have helped its continued development. 
Here are some of those people:

Albert White
Finbarr O'Kane
Helmut Katzgraber
Niall Richard Murphy
Robert Hayes
The members of UCD Internet Society, for years of trying to break flash!
