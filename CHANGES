Changes to flash
----------------
From 0.9.3 to 0.9.4

* BUGFIX: the countdown module had a variable and function with 
  the same name.
  [Albert White: albertw@netsoc.ucd.ie]

* BUGFIX: the install-sh file has been removed and isnt looked for
  by configure now.
  [Albert White: albertw@netsoc.ucd.ie]

* BUGFIX: Extra comments for Solaris have been added to the Makefile
  for compilation with gcc. 
  [Albert White: albertw@netsoc.ucd.ie]

* BUGFIX: Issues with the solaris curses libraries caused make to 
  fail. This has been fixed.
  [Albert White: albertw@netsoc.ucd.ie]

From 0.9.2 to 0.9.3

* BUGFIX: 'make install' now works correctly, provided configure
  can find an install program, otherwise there are instructions
  for what goes where.
  [Albert White: albertw@netsoc.ucd.ie]

* BUGFIX: 'make' now makes the modules in the modules directory.
  [Albert White: albertw@netsoc.ucd.ie]

* DOCUMENTATION: Some minor updates to the README and INSTALL files.
  And added a THANKS file.
  [Albert White: albertw@netsoc.ucd.ie]
  [Niall Murphy: niallm@netsoc.ucd.ie]

* DOCUMENTATION: sample-config/system.menu is now correctly format.
  This was my fault not Niall or Wills!
  [Albert White: albertw@netsoc.ucd.ie]

From 0.9.1 to 0.9.2

* FEATURE: Maildir support. Flash can now understand Maildir
  format mail boxes (used in the mailcheck module). On by default
  (configure --disble-maildir to disable).
  [Finbarr O'Kane: finbarro@netsoc.ucd.ie]

* BUGFIX: Checking for !ENOTTY fixes some 'unexpected quits'
  while waiting for a keypress.
  [Finbarr O'Kane: finbarro@netsoc.ucd.ie]

* BUGFIX: Debug file handling was suboptimal. An inelegant fix
  but it works.
  [Niall Murphy: niallm@netsoc.ucd.ie]

* DOCUMENTATION: Added a 'sample-config' directory with slightly
  less netsoc-ified configuration files.
  [Niall Murphy: niallm@netsoc.ucd.ie]
  [Will Andrews: andrews@technologist.com]

* FEATURE: you can now specify '--enable-maildir' and --prefix=
  to configure. Configure checks if less is available
  as a pager and if not looks for more, useful for systems
  that do not have less as a pager. The definition of VERSION
  was moved to misc.h as it was confusing configure.
  [Albert White: albertw@netsoc.ucd.ie] 

* DOCUMENTATION: Added the GPL, as per the GPL.
